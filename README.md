## Data Types

We will be working with 5 main data types
1.Integer(int) - Whole number
2.String(str) - Collection of characters
3.Character(char) - One character(letter or symbol)
4.Float - Decimal number
5.Boolean(bool) - True/False (1/0)

## Variables

`myName = "Debanshi"`

Variables are containers and they vold a value 

## Rules for Variable Names

1.Always start with a letter

`1Name` = "Debanshi" --> NOT ALLOWED

2. Can only contain numbers,letters, and underscores(_)

`my name = "Debanshi" --> NOT ALLOWED

3.If more than one word, use camelCase or underscores to seperate words.

`myFirstName = "Debanshi"` `or my_First_Name = "Debanshi"
